<h3>Is my juvenile record a criminal conviction?</h3>
<p>
	No, a juvenile record is not a criminal conviction, even if you were "found guilty" in juvenile court. In Illinois, you cannot be convicted of a crime in juvenile court, because juvenile court is separate from (adult) criminal court. If a job application asks you about criminal convictions, you should not reveal your juvenile record. If you think a job has seen your juvenile record, contact the Juvenile Expungement Help Desk at 312-229-6359.
